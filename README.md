# KNN-REGRESSOR

I have created Machine Learning Model with K nearest neighbour of DIAMOND PRICE PREDICTION.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [Imblearn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/), [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and much more for Analysis, Vizualization and Model Development.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

**Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://github.com/bobbycodder/KNN-REGRESSOR)!**


### About this file
    A data frame with 53940 rows and 10 variables:
    price
    price in US dollars (\$326--\$18,823)
    carat
    weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)
    cut
    quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
    color
    diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)
    clarity
    a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
    x
    length in mm (0--10.74)
    y
    width in mm (0--58.9)
    z
    depth in mm (0--31.8)
    depth
    total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)
    table
    width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)
